# User Documentation
Welcome to the Distribution List Generator. The goal of this application is to view pre-defined lists of users, and create custom lists that you can paste into an email client to mass email, or to simply keep track of people. A bonus feature is notes, which allows you to make notes about people and view notes others have made about people.

## Features
* Pre-defined reports
* Custom lists
* Notes

## Basic use
Basic use of the program involves navigating to the webpage, and then clicking either Reports or Notes on the main page.

## Reports
Clicking reports brings you to a selection menu of 6 different reports. Each of them should have a helpful description that tells you what the report does. Some reports have a select menu for relevant parameters, feel free to use this to narrow your report down.

## Notes
Clicking notes brings you to a page that has a table that shows current people who have notes about them. If the table is blank, it means there aren't any notes yet entered in the system. If you want to add a new note, click `New Note` at the top and it should bring you to an easy-to-use form. 

From the main screen, you can also click `View Notes` and it will show you the contents of the notes for the person picked. You can then click `Edit` or `Delete` to perform the respective actions.
